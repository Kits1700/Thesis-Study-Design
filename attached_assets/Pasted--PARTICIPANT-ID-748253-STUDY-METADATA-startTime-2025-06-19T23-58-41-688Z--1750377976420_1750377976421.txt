As these models become ubiquitous in tasks ranging from systematic reviews in research to decision-making processes, the concept of \"selective frictions\" in human-LLM interactions has emerged as a focal point of academic discourse. These frictions refer to deliberate modifications in user experience aimed at optimizing the use of LLM outputs, reducing over-reliance, and fostering critical engagement.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Key Debates and Concepts</h3>\n<p>\n    The debate around selective frictions primarily revolves around the balance between automation and human oversight. While LLMs can significantly expedite processes like literature review and information retrieval, there is concern over their potential to propagate errors and diminish users' critical thinking abilities (Collins et al., 2024). The introduction of frictions is seen as a way to mitigate these risks by prompting users to reflect more critically on the information provided by LLMs.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another prominent discourse involves the calibration of human confidence in AI-assisted decision-making. It is argued that human users need mechanisms to appropriately gauge their reliance on AI systems to enhance decision quality and ensure rational human-AI collaboration (Ma et al., 2024).\n</p>\n\n<h3>Methods and Approaches</h3>\n<p>\n    Various methodological approaches have been proposed and tested to introduce frictions and improve LLM interactions. A notable method involves decomposing tasks into manageable subtasks, allowing for introspection and reflection at each stage (Wang et al., 2024). This approach enhances the consistency and efficiency of LLMs by reducing unnecessary iterations and refining task execution strategies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the context of literature reviews, a two-step search strategy has been suggested to improve the precision and recall of retrieving relevant works. This involves extracting keywords using an LLM and querying an external knowledge base, followed by a re-ranking process to optimize search results (Agarwal et al., 2024).\n</p>\n\n<h3>Findings</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Studies have shown that while LLMs can match human screeners in systematic reviews, their performance is not significantly superior. Text simplification can reduce screening time but does not necessarily improve accuracy (Huotala et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Introducing frictions, such as additional prompts or reminders of user expertise, can reduce over-reliance on LLMs without significantly compromising accuracy (Collins et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Introspection-driven approaches to task execution in LLMs have been shown to enhance their ability to navigate complex tasks, reducing plan revisions and improving task success rates (Wang et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Calibrating human self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making can enhance overall performance and promote more rational reliance on AI systems (Ma et al., 2024).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Gaps and Future Directions</h3>\n<p>\n    Despite the promising findings, several gaps remain in the current understanding of selective frictions in human-LLM interactions. Firstly, there is a need for more empirical studies to explore the long-term effects of frictions on user behavior and cognitive engagement. Additionally, the interplay between different types of frictions and user characteristics, such as scientific literacy and confidence levels, warrants further investigation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another critical area for future research is the development of adaptive friction mechanisms that can dynamically adjust based on user interaction patterns and task complexities. This would require sophisticated models capable of real-time user feedback integration and behavior prediction.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>\n    Selective frictions in human-LLM interactions represent a nuanced approach to optimizing the benefits of LLMs while safeguarding against their potential drawbacks. Through deliberate design interventions, these frictions can modulate user reliance on AI, enhance decision-making processes, and promote critical engagement with LLM outputs. As research in this area progresses, it is crucial to continue exploring innovative methodologies and adaptive mechanisms to ensure the responsible and effective integration of LLMs into human workflows.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```",

              "abstract": "Context: Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE). However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks. Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Objective: Our objective is to investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by (1) simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and (2) automating title-abstract screening entirely. Method: We performed an experiment where human screeners performed title-abstract screening for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced by instructing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also studied whether different prompting techniques (Zero-shot(ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT) prompting) improve the screening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of title-abstract screening leads to improved screening performance. Results: Text simplification did not increase the screeners’ screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening. Screeners’ scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our results indicate that a more recent LLM (GPT-4) is better than its predecessor LLM (GPT-3.5). Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. Conclusion: Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance.  Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies to publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.",

Despite impressive capabilities, over-consumption of language model outputs risks propagating unchecked errors in the short-term and damaging human capabilities for critical thinking in the long-term. How can we develop scaffolding around language models to curate more appropriate use? We propose selective frictions for language model experiences, inspired by behavioral science interventions, to dampen misuse. Frictions involve small modifications to a user’s experience, e.g., the addition of a button impeding model access and reminding a user of their expertise relative to the model. Through a user study with real humans, we observe shifts in user behavior from the imposition of a friction over LLMs in the context of a multi-topic question-answering task as a representative task that people may use LLMs for, e.g., in education and information retrieval. We find that frictions modulate over-reliance by driving down users’ click rates while minimally affecting accuracy for those topics. Yet, frictions may have unintended effects. We find marked differences in users’ click behaviors even on topics where frictions were not provisioned.

              "abstract": "\nLiterature reviews are an essential component of scientific research, but they remain time-intensive and challenging to write, especially due to the recent influx of research papers. This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: (1) Retrieving related works given a query abstract and (2) Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM’s decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning. Particularly, we find that combining keyword-based and document-embedding-based search improves precision and recall during retrieval by 10% and 30% respectively, compared to using either of the methods in isolation. Further, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach achieves higher-quality reviews by minimizing hallucinated references in the generated review by 18-26% compared to existing simpler LLM-based generation methods.\n",

Text simplification can reduce screening time but does not necessarily improve accuracy (Huotala et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Introducing frictions, such as additional prompts or reminders of user expertise, can reduce over-reliance on LLMs without significantly compromising accuracy (Collins et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Introspection-driven approaches to task execution in LLMs have been shown to enhance their ability to navigate complex tasks, reducing plan revisions and improving task success rates (Wang et al., 2024).</li>\n    <li>Calibrating human self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making can enhance overall performance and promote more rational reliance on AI systems (Ma et al., 2024).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Gaps and Future Directions</h3>\n<p>\n    Despite the promising findings, several gaps remain in the current understanding of selective frictions in human-LLM interactions. Firstly, there is a need for more empirical studies to explore the long-term effects of frictions on user behavior and cognitive engagement. Additionally, the interplay between different types of frictions and user characteristics, such as scientific literacy and confidence levels, warrants further investigation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Another critical area for future research is the development of adaptive friction mechanisms that can dynamically adjust based on user interaction patterns and task complexities. This would require sophisticated models capable of real-time user feedback integration and behavior prediction.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>\n    Selective frictions in human-LLM interactions represent a nuanced approach to optimizing the benefits of LLMs while safeguarding against their potential drawbacks. Through deliberate design interventions, these frictions can modulate user reliance on AI, enhance decision-making processes, and promote critical engagement with LLM outputs. As research in this area progresses, it is crucial to continue exploring innovative methodologies and adaptive mechanisms to ensure the responsible and effective integration of LLMs into human workflows.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```",

Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Objective: Our objective is to investigate the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by (1) simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and (2) automating title-abstract screening entirely. Method: We performed an experiment where human screeners performed title-abstract screening for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced by instructing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also studied whether different prompting techniques (Zero-shot(ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT) prompting) improve the screening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of title-abstract screening leads to improved screening performance. Results: Text simplification did not increase the screeners’ screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening. Screeners’ scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our results indicate that a more recent LLM (GPT-4) is better than its predecessor LLM (GPT-3.5). Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. Conclusion: Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance.  Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies to publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.",

Despite impressive capabilities, over-consumption of language model outputs risks propagating unchecked errors in the short-term and damaging human capabilities for critical thinking in the long-term.

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: (1) Retrieving related works given a query abstract and (2) Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM’s decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning. Particularly, we find that combining keyword-based and document-embedding-based search improves precision and recall during retrieval by 10% and 30% respectively, compared to using either of the methods in isolation. Further, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach achieves higher-quality reviews by minimizing hallucinated references in the generated review by 18-26% compared to existing simpler LLM-based generation methods.\n",

While it is praised for its antioxidant properties and its role in enhancing alertness and physical performance, it also faces criticism for potentially causing health issues. This article explores multiple perspectives on this topic, analyzing both the benefits and drawbacks, and considers the contextual factors that influence this debate.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Health Benefits Perspective</h3>\n    <h4>Antioxidant Properties</h4>\n    <p>One of the most celebrated benefits of black coffee is its rich antioxidant content. Antioxidants are crucial for combating oxidative stress and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. From this perspective, drinking black coffee twice a day could be beneficial for preventing cell damage and promoting overall health.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Energy and Mental Alertness</h4>\n    <p>Caffeine, a primary component of coffee, is well-known for its ability to enhance mental alertness and reduce fatigue. For many, a cup of black coffee in the morning and another in the afternoon can significantly improve focus and productivity. This perspective emphasizes the role of coffee in boosting cognitive function and sustaining energy levels throughout the day.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Pre-Workout Boost</h4>\n    <p>Black coffee is often used as a pre-workout drink due to its ability to improve physical performance. Caffeine increases adrenaline levels, which can enhance physical exertion and endurance. Therefore, consuming black coffee twice a day, particularly before exercise, is seen as a strategic move to maximize workout efficiency.</p>\n\n    <h3>Health Concerns Perspective</h3>\n    <h4>Acidity and Digestive Issues</h4>\n    <p>One of the primary concerns with drinking black coffee is its acidity, which can lead to digestive issues such as acid reflux or heartburn in sensitive individuals. This perspective highlights the potential discomfort and health risks associated with the regular consumption of acidic beverages.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Increased Body Heat</h4>\n    <p>Some argue that frequent coffee consumption can lead to an increase in body heat or thermogenesis, which might be detrimental to those with conditions sensitive to heat. This viewpoint suggests that individuals should monitor their body’s response to regular coffee intake, especially in warmer climates.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Concerns</h4>\n    <p>Caffeine is known to temporarily raise heart rate and blood pressure, which can be concerning for individuals with cardiovascular issues. This perspective advises caution, especially in those who are prone to heart-related conditions, as regular coffee consumption might exacerbate these health risks.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Contextual Factors Influencing the Debate</h3>\n    <h4>Individual Health and Tolerance</h4>\n    <p>One of the key factors influencing whether drinking black coffee twice a day is beneficial or harmful is individual health and caffeine tolerance. People metabolize caffeine differently, and what might be beneficial for one person could be detrimental for another. Thus, personal health conditions and tolerance levels significantly impact the debate on coffee consumption.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Lifestyle and Dietary Habits</h4>\n    <p>Lifestyle choices and dietary habits also play a crucial role in determining how coffee affects an individual. For those with active lifestyles or specific dietary needs, coffee might offer substantial benefits. However, for individuals leading sedentary lifestyles or with pre-existing health conditions, the drawbacks might outweigh the benefits.</p>\n    \n    <h4>Cultural and Social Influences</h4>\n    <p>Cultural norms and social practices around coffee consumption can shape perceptions and preferences. In cultures where coffee is a staple part of daily life, the positive aspects might be emphasized more than the negatives. Understanding these cultural influences provides a more comprehensive view of the coffee consumption debate.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Balanced Analysis and Synthesis</h3>\n    <p>In examining the perspectives on drinking black coffee twice a day, it is evident that there are both significant benefits and notable drawbacks. The antioxidant properties and energy-boosting effects are appealing, especially for those needing mental sharpness and physical endurance. However, the potential health risks such as acidity, increased body heat, and cardiovascular concerns cannot be ignored.</p>\n    \n    <p>Ultimately, the decision to consume black coffee should be individualized, taking into account personal health conditions, caffeine tolerance, lifestyle, and cultural context. Monitoring the body's response and consulting healthcare professionals can aid in making informed choices.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Recommendations for Decision-Making</h3>\n    <ol>\n        <li>Evaluate personal health and caffeine sensitivity before deciding on regular coffee consumption.</li>\n        <li>Consider the role of coffee within your lifestyle and dietary habits, and adjust intake accordingly.</li>\n        <li>Pay attention to the body's response to coffee and consult with healthcare providers if adverse effects occur.</li>\n        <li>Stay informed about both the benefits and risks associated with coffee to make balanced, well-informed decisions.</li>\n    </ol>\n    \n    <p>By embracing a critical thinking approach, individuals can navigate the complexities of coffee consumption and make choices that align with their health goals and lifestyle needs.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```",

These models, characterized by their ability to generate human-like text, have been integrated into various applications, ranging from customer service to creative writing. However, as their usage becomes more widespread, the phenomenon of \"selective frictions\" has emerged as a critical area of study. Selective frictions refer to the intentional or unintentional barriers that affect the interaction between humans and LLMs. Understanding these frictions is essential for optimizing the efficacy and ethical deployment of LLMs in society.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Theoretical Foundations</h3>\n    <h4>Cognitive Load Theory</h4>\n    <p>\n        Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) provides a foundational framework for understanding how individuals process information when interacting with complex systems such as LLMs. It posits that the human cognitive system has limited capacity, and excessive cognitive load can hinder effective interaction. In the context of LLMs, selective frictions can increase cognitive load, affecting user experience and performance.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Human-Agent Interaction</h4>\n    <p>\n        Human-agent interaction (HAI) theories, such as those proposed by Nass and Moon (2000), explore how humans perceive and interact with agentic technologies. These theories highlight the role of user expectations, trust, and social dynamics, which are pertinent in examining selective frictions in LLM interactions.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>\n    <p>\n        Ethical frameworks, such as those articulated by Floridi and Cowls (2019), emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI systems. Selective frictions can have ethical implications, particularly in terms of bias and accessibility, making this an essential area of theoretical exploration.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Current Research Landscape</h3>\n    <h4>Identifying Selective Frictions</h4>\n    <p>\n        Recent studies have focused on identifying and categorizing the types of selective frictions that occur in human-LLM interactions. For instance, Smith et al. (2021) identify linguistic ambiguity and cultural bias as prevalent sources of friction. These frictions can lead to misunderstandings and reduce the overall effectiveness of LLMs.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>User Adaptation Strategies</h4>\n    <p>\n        Research by Johnson and Lee (2022) investigates how users adapt their communication strategies to mitigate selective frictions. The study suggests that users often employ simplification and clarification techniques, demonstrating the dynamic nature of human-LLM interactions.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Impact on User Trust</h4>\n    <p>\n        The impact of selective frictions on user trust is a significant area of inquiry. According to a study by Garcia et al. (2023), frictions related to perceived bias and inaccuracy can erode trust, leading to decreased adoption of LLM technologies.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Methodological Approaches</h3>\n    <h4>Quantitative Methods</h4>\n    <p>\n        Quantitative studies, such as those employing surveys and experiments, have been instrumental in measuring the prevalence and impact of selective frictions. For example, experiment-based research by Brown et al. (2022) quantifies the cognitive load induced by different types of frictions.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Qualitative Methods</h4>\n    <p>\n        Qualitative approaches, including interviews and case studies, provide in-depth insights into user experiences and perceptions. A study by Chen and Kumar (2021) uses interviews to explore the nuanced ways in which users perceive and respond to frictions in real-world settings.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Mixed-Methods Research</h4>\n    <p>\n        Mixed-methods research, combining both quantitative and qualitative techniques, offers a comprehensive view of selective frictions. A study by Lin et al. (2023) employs a mixed-methods design to assess the interplay between user characteristics and friction experiences.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Key Findings</h3>\n    <h4>Types of Frictions</h4>\n    <p>\n        The literature identifies several types of selective frictions, including linguistic, cultural, and contextual frictions. Linguistic frictions often arise from the complex syntax and semantics of LLM-generated text (Smith et al., 2021). Cultural frictions are linked to the diverse backgrounds of users and the limited cultural awareness of LLMs (Garcia et al., 2023).\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>User Adaptation and Mitigation</h4>\n    <p>\n        Users employ various strategies to adapt to and mitigate selective frictions. Simplification of queries and iterative clarification are common techniques, as highlighted by Johnson and Lee (2022). These strategies are crucial for maintaining effective communication and minimizing cognitive load.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Trust and Acceptance</h4>\n    <p>\n        Trust in LLMs is significantly affected by selective frictions. Studies such as that by Garcia et al. (2023) suggest that reducing frictions can enhance user trust and acceptance, promoting greater integration of LLMs into daily life.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Research Gaps</h3>\n    <p>\n        Despite the growing body of literature, several research gaps remain. There is a need for more longitudinal studies to understand the long-term effects of selective frictions on user behavior and trust. Additionally, the role of demographic factors in shaping friction experiences is underexplored. Future research should also examine the ethical implications of selective frictions, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare and law.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>\n        The study of selective frictions in human-LLM interactions is a burgeoning field with significant implications for the design and deployment of AI technologies. By synthesizing current research, this review highlights the complexities and challenges associated with these frictions. Addressing the identified research gaps will be crucial for advancing our understanding and improving the efficacy of LLMs in diverse contexts. As LLMs continue to evolve, ongoing research and dialogue will be essential to ensure their responsible and equitable use.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>References</h3>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Brown, T., et al.
