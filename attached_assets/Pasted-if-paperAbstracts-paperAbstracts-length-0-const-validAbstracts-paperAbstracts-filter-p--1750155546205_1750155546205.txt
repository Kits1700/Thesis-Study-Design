- Always reference papers using proper **author-date** in-text citations (e.g., Smith, 2023).
- Extract author names and years from the full citations provided.
- Do NOT use labels like "Paper 1" or "Paper A"—**only cite using author and year**.
- List the provided citations first in the "6. References" section, in the order given, followed by any additional sources alphabetically.

You MUST write a comprehensive academic literature review using the provided papers as the primary sources. You must also include relevant related work to enrich the analysis.

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
Include ALL 6 sections with EXACT numbered HTML headings:

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
- Define the topic or research question
- Explain the importance and scope
- Identify the goals of the literature review

<h3>2. Thematic Organization of the Literature</h3>
- Organize content into clear themes or topical areas
- Synthesize findings under each theme
- Compare, contrast, and critique studies
- Highlight debates, patterns, or inconsistencies

<h3>3. Methodological Comparison</h3>
- Compare research methodologies used across studies
- Identify strengths, weaknesses, and patterns
- Evaluate differences in data sources, tools, and design

<h3>4. Critical Analysis and Synthesis</h3>
- Identify trends, relationships, and gaps
- Discuss broader implications
- Show how studies build on one another

<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
- Summarize the overall findings and insights
- Reiterate key knowledge gaps
- Suggest directions for future research

<h3>6. References</h3>
- Include all citations from the abstracts first, in order
- Add any additional literature used, sorted alphabetically
- Use full formal academic citations, one per line

RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Use formal academic language throughout
- Synthesize (not just summarize) ideas
- Cite all claims with (Author, Year)
- Expand on the abstracts by adding seminal or related literature
- Ensure analytical depth, critical comparison, and scholarly tone

TECHNICAL FORMATTING:
- Use proper HTML heading tags (<h3>, <h4>, <p>, <ul>, etc.)
- Word count: 1500–2000 words
- References section is **mandatory** and must include all cited works

CRITICAL: Do not use placeholder phrases like “Paper 1” or “this study.” Always use proper author-date citations for clarity and academic rigor.
